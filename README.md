# CSS/SCSS Layout: Flexbox & Grid

- CSS flex box appeared in context of solving manual positioning of boxes
- It's important to understand what problem that the technology has solved, instead of just learning stuff what other people think is valuable.

## Flexbox

### [üê∏ Practice at flexboxfroggy! üê∏](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

- Only talk to the flexbox container outside, don't talk to the children. 
- Direct father controls the positioning of the children content
  ex) .wrapper is father of .box

### [Flex-direction and axis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Ordering_Flex_Items)

```css
.father {
	display:flex 
}
```

display flex sets default flex-direction as row

### **When flex-direction is row,**

```css
.father {
	display:flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

![Basics1](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15649/Basics1.png)

- Main axis is x-axis
  - justify-content move childrens on main axis (= justify-content modify lines of main axis)

![Basics3](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15616/Basics3.png)

- Cross axis is y-axis
  - align-items move children on cross axis (= align-items modify lines of cross axis)

### **When flex-direction is column,**

```css
.father {
	display:flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

![align10](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15650/align10.png)

- Main axis is y-axis
  - justify-content move childrens on main axis (= justify-content modify lines of main axis)

![Basics4](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15617/Basics4.png)

- Cross axis is x-axis
  - align-items move children on cross axis (= align-items modify lines of cross axis)
  
- justify-content & align-items can be used in any elements: it affects subordinated children elements. 

### When flex-direction is row-reverse ( or column reverse)

```css
.father {
	display:flex;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
 	/*flex-direction: column-reverse;*/
}
```

- Axis layout is the same. 
- Only left-to-right sequential arraying is reversed as right-to-left.

### [align-self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self)

```css
.father {
	display:flex;
  flex-direction: flex-start;
}

.yellow{
  align-self: flex-end;
}
```

- Overrides father flexbox's align-items
- Child element will move along cross axis

### align-content

```css
.father {
  display:flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: space-between
}
```

- **aligning lines (of frogs)** along cross axis

![image-20200319145711708](image-20200319145711708.png)

### order

```css
/* right */
.child {
  background: peru;
  order: 1;
}

/* left */
.child:nth-child(2) {
  order: -1;
}

/* middle */
.child:nth-child(3) {
  order: 0;
}
```

- flexbox order is **sequentially assigning children itself** along main axis of father flexbox.
- default is 0
- comparing orders like 0<1 or -1<0 will shift the elements along the main axis of father flexbox.

### [flex-wrap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap)

```css
.father {
  flex-wrap: wrap
}
```

- wrap means keep the size of the children, when window ran out of spaces
- wrap also means to make multiple lines along father flexbox's main axis
- flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; is reverse direction of main axis
- default value is nowrap
- nowrap means cram everyting in one father (line), even if sizes of children are shrunk

### flex-shrink

```css
.father {
	flex-wrap: nowrap;
}

.child{
  flex-shrink: 2;
}
```

- enabled only when father doesn't respect the size of children
- kicks in when window ran out of spaces, along the main-axis
- default value is 1
- flex-shrink value 2 means it is 200% more likely to shrink than the other children

### flex-grow

```css
.child{
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.child:nth-child(2) {
  flex-grow: 2;
}

.child:nth-child(3) {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

- enabled regardless of flex-wrap.
- flex-grow takes the space that is available to grow in the window, along the main-axis

- default value is 0, which means that child will keep its size, doesn't take space that is available to grow
- flex-grow value 1 and 2 is proportional to each other: it grows twice more than the other children

### [flex-basis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis)

```css
.father {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  width: 100wh;
}

.child {
  flex-basis: 30%;
  /* flex-basis: 100px; */
}
```

- Sizing element along the main-axis of the father flexbox
- flex-basis % is percentage of size of father flexbox
  ex: if father flexbox width is 100wh and if child's flex-basis is 30%, then size of the child will be 30wh
- You can also give fixed pixel values to the child box



## Grid

```css
.father {
  display: grid;
}
```

usually talking to father, not to children
