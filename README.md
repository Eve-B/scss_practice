# SCSS Masterclass

(S)CSS Layout Masterclass: Flexbox & Grid

- CSS flex box appeared in context of solving manual positioning of boxes
- It's important to understand what problem that the technology has solved, instead of just learning stuff what other people think is valuable.

## Flexbox:

- Only talk to the flexbox container outside, don't talk to the children. 

- Direct father controls the positioning of the children content
  ex) .wrapper is father of .box
